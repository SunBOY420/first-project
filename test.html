<h2>Hell boy</h2>
<p id="lyrics"> <b>[Intro: Hellboy Animated: Blood and Iron Sample] <br>
  Can this be him? <br>
  The one I have waited centuries to see? <br>
  How strange <br>
  So far from his path that I barely see the promise of glory <br>
  Can this be him, this Hellboy? <br><br>
  
  [Chorus] <br>
  You don't even know what I've been through (What I've been through) <br>
  You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (Bitch do) <br>
  Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (Like I miss you) <br>
  You know I love you by the way that I kiss you <br>
  You don't even know what I've been through (What I've been through) <br>
  You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (Bitch do) <br>
  Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (Like I miss you) <br>
  You know I love you by the way that I kiss you <br> <br>
  
  [Verse] <br>
  Leave me to bleed, I know I got you on your knees <br>
  But somethin' keeps on tellin' me <br>
  It keeps on tellin' me <br>
  Peep, leave it alone, I'm good on my own <br>
  Mama miss me at home, but I'm good on my own <br>
  Baby, I'm cold, back on the road <br>
  Show after show, fuckin' ho after ho <br>
  I swear it gets so lonely sometimes <br>
  Please just hold me one time <br>
  Fuck these hoes and fuck life <br>
  I've been waitin' here all damn night <br>
  Not one call or text from you (Yeah, ayy) <br>
  You're the same as my ex, fuck you <br>
  Damn, bitch <br> <br>
  
  [Chorus] <br>
  You don't even know what I've been through (What I've been through) <br>
  You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (Bitch do) <br>
  Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (Like I miss you) <br> 
  You know I love you by the way that I kiss you <br>
  You don't even know what I've been through (What I've been through) <br>
  You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (Bitch do) <br>
  Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (Like I miss you) <br>
  You know I love you by the way that I kiss you </b></p>
